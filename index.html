              <b>"Kevin - third year EECS major", is how I introduce myself on the first day of class.</b>
              </p>
              <p>
              I've been messing around with computers since I was in middle school. My first project was a Visual Basic program that controlled a robot over RS232.
              I was part of a ROV club that built little underwater vehicles, but I didn't like that we controlled the motors directly. What I wanted was a way to control
              the ROV using a game controller, which would require a computer program to translate the joystick inputs into motor directives.
              </p>
              <p>
              I'd like to say I've learned a lot since then. That first project was little more than a cobbled-together mess of snippets from the internet, but between my
              <a href="#education">classes</a> at Berkeley, various <a href="#work-experience">internships</a>, and <a href="#projects">projects</a>, I've learned a lot.
              Particularly because of my time as a Unix Sysadmin at ResComp, I've grown to admire the complexity of operating systems and networks. I don't admire the complexity
              for its own sake, mind you, but because I look at it and think "how the <i>hell</i> does this work? Whoever designed this made some good choices". This interest in
              networking led me to my <a href="#research">research</a> with NetSys on DI.
              </p>
              <p>
              When I'm not working with computers, I'm probably playing pool, cooking, or fishing. They're all arts that become more and more interesting the more you learn about them. 
              </p>
              <p>
              My big realization with billiards was that everything that happens on the pool table is more or less determinsistic. Different (but controllable) things happen when
              you hit the cue ball in different places, when you shoot at different angles, even when you shoot at a soft vs. fast pace.
              </p>
              <p>
              I like to say that cooking is the oldest study. It amazes me to think that the things I do in the kitchen are the results of thousands of years of refinement by tons
              of different cultures. It thus has this unique combination of history (every person in history had to eat) and science 
              (when you make a cake, what does baking soda really <i>do</i>?). I particularly enjoy baking bread. The physical act of kneading the dough, the simplicity of the ingredients,
              the fact that the byproduct of <i>living things</i> is a critical ingredient, the ubiquity across cultures, all make me have a reverence for this simple baked good.
              Seriously, if you want to talk about bread over coffee, send me an email.
              </p>
              <p>
              I grew up in Monterey, CA so I was always close to the ocean. There's a certain camaraderie at a fishing pier
              that's so relaxing. When there's action, everyone starts yelling, switching out their rigs, and casting -- when there's one fish, there's probably more fish.
              When there's a lull, people are relaxed, watching the water or chatting while lazily casting. As President Hoover said, 
              <i>“Fishing is a discipline in the equality of men – for all men are equal before fish.”</i>

          <h3>Software Engineering Intern</h3>
          <h4 class="text-muted">Jun - Aug 2015</h4>
          <p>At eBay, I worked on setting up a system for analyzing logs using LogStash, Elasticsearch, and Kibana. The idea was that
          it's often difficult to figure out what went wrong from a log dump, so I created a modeling system for expected log events that
          could be created once, and then shared with other developers.</p>
