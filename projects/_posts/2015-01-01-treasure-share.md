Treasure Share was my first experience with bitcoin. It was a finalist for the
Koinify award. The idea came about because
we realized that although there are often lots of charities with the same goal,
they would benefit from working together. For example, a large charity might have
the reach to put into action the creative ideas of a smaller, local charity.

We took advantage of multisig encryption in bitcoin wallets. Basically, we placed
donated money into a bitcoin wallet that could only be withdrawn when all parties
signed the wallet. This way, there would be incentive for both parties to come to
an agreement on how they would spend the money, so that they would both commit to
withdrawing it.
