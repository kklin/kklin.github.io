This project has a special place in my heart because it was my first big, solo, programming project.
I first came up with it as a sophomore in high school.

The basic idea is that because sounds are nothing more than a combination of frequencies at different amplitudes 
(that we can decompose and compose using fourier transforms) we can tweak these frequencies and amplitudes to encode information. Furthermore,
our ears can't really tell the difference between amplitudes at very high frequencies, so we can get
away with messing with those frequencies.

During my freshman year at UC Berkeley, I worked with Sourcegraph on a <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/blog/117135271119/kicking-off-the-1st-sourcegraph-open-source">
fellowship</a> to continue developing this as an open source project.
