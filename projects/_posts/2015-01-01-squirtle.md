Squirtle won the Most Useful award at the 2015 UC Berkeley Hackjam. It
makes it easy to save and share the scroll state, form information, and
highlighted text. It works by encoding the relevant information into a URL,
which is then parsed and applied by a Google Chrome Extension on the receiving
end.

The code is [here](github.com/DerBarenJude/Squirtle). You can also install it through
the Chrome app store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/squirtle/ikfmiieigckolmjfhjbdpfjhdmgdfmjo).
