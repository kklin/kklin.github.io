This was a fun little project that sought to bring Slackbot to Facebook messenger.
Because of Project M, this project is basically dead. Hopefully once Facebook releases
a public API for their chat bots I'll build more stuff.

It's very hacky, running inside a Google Chrome Extension that manipulated the Facebook page directly.
It would've been better as a node app, but oh well. This project is kind of significant because it was
one of my first forays into javascript.

It has support for Github notifications, getting weather, generating gifs, searching wikipedia, creating
TODO lists, along with other little features.

Take a look at the source [here](https://github.com/kklin/facebot).
